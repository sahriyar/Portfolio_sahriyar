                <h1 class="heading">Website Design</h1>
                <p>One of the requirements of the website design procedures is to specify how you want your business website to appear, 
                and according to HubSpot study, 72 percent of business websites have earned a failing grade of 59 percent or worse. 
                Knowing this will assist you in properly setting your website design goals and objectives to guarantee long-term and maximum success.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Website<br>Development</h1>
                <p>"We want a better website," like "we want a better business," is a cliche. But what does "a better business" entail? Do you want to boost your revenue? 
                Profitability should be maximized. Or perhaps increase consumer satisfaction? 
                This might signify a variety of things to different individuals in various contexts. Unfortunately, 
                merely desiring a better website is not a clear goal, 
                and many experts discover the hard way that simply saying so will not result in commercial outcomes.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Software<br>Development</h1>
                <p>Software development is a collection of computer science activities devoted to the process of generating, designing, deploying, 
                and maintaining software. Software is a collection of instructions or programs that tell a machine what to do. 
                It is hardware agnostic and allows computers to be programmed.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Javascript<br>Development</h1>
                <p>JavaScript is a dynamic, multi-paradigm language having types and operators, as well as standard built-in objects and functions. 
                Its grammar is based on the Java and C programming languages, and many structures from those languages are also applicable to JavaScript. 
                Object prototypes and classes in JavaScript allow for object-oriented programming. 
                It also allows functional programming since functions are first-class objects that can be generated using expressions and handed around just like any other object.</p>
